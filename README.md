# Electric-motor-temperature-prediction-using-machine-learning
This project focuses on predicting the temperature of an electric motor using Machine Learning techniques. Overheating in electric motors can reduce performance and cause damage, so accurate temperature prediction helps in improving safety and efficiency.

The model is trained using sensor data such as voltage, current, speed, torque, and ambient temperature. Different regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are used to analyze the data and predict motor temperature.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze motor sensor data

To build a regression model for temperature prediction

To compare different machine learning algorithms
